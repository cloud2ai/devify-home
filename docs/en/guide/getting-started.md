## Core Concepts

### Conversations

AImyChats treats each forwarded email or message thread as a conversation. Conversations are automatically:

- Parsed and structured
- Summarized by AI
- Categorized by context
- Made searchable

### AI Image Recognition + Multi-Scenario Analysis

Our core advantages - AI recognizes images and analyzes based on scenarios:

**Image Recognition**:
- **Auto-recognize image content**: Screenshots, charts, photos
- **OCR text extraction**: Extract text from images
- **Chart data understanding**: Analyze data charts and statistics

**Multi-Scenario Smart Analysis**:
- **Select scenario**: Work, Customer Support, Product Discussion, Technical Support, etc.
- **Targeted analysis**: Different scenarios, different focus points
- **Support scenario**: Extract customer issues and requests
- **Product scenario**: Identify feature requirements and details
- **Work scenario**: Extract action items and assignees

**Text+Image+Scenario Combined**:
- **Topic Identification**: Accurately identify topics using text, images, AND scenario context
- **Key Information Extraction**: Extract scenario-relevant important info from text AND images
- **More Accurate Summaries**: Because AI "understands" images AND adapts to scenario needs!

This is what makes AImyChats different - we don't just save and understand content, we understand the context.

- **Free**: 5 emails/month, 1 GB storage, 30-day retention
